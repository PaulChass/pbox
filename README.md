# A solution to John Crickett's Dropbox Challenge

This repository contains my solution to John Crickett's coding challenge.
(https://codingchallenges.fyi/challenges/challenge-dropbox/)
 The project is divided into two main parts: the backend and the frontend.
  
## Project Overview

### Backend

The backend is built with Node.js and Express. It handles API requests, authentication, and database interactions.

### Frontend

The frontend is built with React and was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app). It provides a user interface for interacting with the backend services.
